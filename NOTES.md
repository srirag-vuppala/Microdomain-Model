Notes for the microdomain model
---

1. For the first pass, we'll consider epsilon = 0 so we can remove H from our Ionic term
2. How do we compute gap junctional resistance?
3. I think generate_E_matrix correctly generates E compared to create_E
    - Comparing to the notes we've made we defined C = [E 0] but the generate_E_matrix essentially makes the C matrix.
4. I think we still need to incorporate the gap junctional term as a diffusion term?
